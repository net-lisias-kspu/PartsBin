	description = The JX2 Larege Deployable Antenna was commisioned by Blinkelights LLC after someone asked "What happens if we go further out than the Kerbol system?". It most definitly is not in response to any vessels having accidentally already acheived an escape trajectory of the system, nope nothing to do with that issue at all.
